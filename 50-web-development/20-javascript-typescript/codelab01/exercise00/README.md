# Exercise 00 - Hoisting

The `index.js` file contains the hoist function from the _Variable declaration_ slide.

- Make sure you actually call the function somewhere in `index.js`
- Run it by opening the `index.html` file in your browser
- Open the `console` in your browser's `DevTools` and check what output you get for `h`
- Now implement the same function with `let` or `const` and check the output again
