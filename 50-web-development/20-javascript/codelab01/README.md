# Codelab 01 - Silly Story Generator
Hi kids, today we're going to create a random silly story generator!
To see the finished result you can check [this page](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/introduction-to-js-1/assessment-finished/) (but no peeking at the source code).

If you play around with it you can see that clicking the **Generate random story** button generates a story with random names, places and actions. The temperature and weight in the story changes unit based on if UK is selected or not and the whole thing is seen by 'Bob' or a custom name if one is filled in.

Some things are a bit different in the codelab, so don't look at the example too much in detail. For example, we changed the UK radio button to a checkbox since this made more sense. Also, the temperature and weight in the story will be generated at random as well.
